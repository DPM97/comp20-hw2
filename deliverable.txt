000webhost: https://comp20dylan.000webhostapp.com/

Questions:
1. github - I am definately more familiar with it, it allows me to push code from cmd line & automatically updates the site per commit. cpanel - pretty good & intuitive interface /  easier for beginners. 
2. personally I would rather create a quick express api and host on heroku or AWS but I would choose github because of the reasons listed above if I had to choose between the two.
3. I was honestly pretty suprised how easy the 000webhost was to upload files / put the site online. Back when CPANEL was outdated it took FOREVER to get a working site - I think nowadays anyone can figure out how to host a simple webpage / site with no prior tech knowledge.
