github: https://dpm97.github.io/comp20-hw2/index.html
000webhost: https://comp20dylan.000webhostapp.com

Questions:
1. github is definately easier to update through cmd line, however, their hosting is pretty limiting and it doesn't automatically choose index.html as the root.
2. personally I would rather create a quick express api and host on heroku or AWS but JUST because of the root issue I would choose 000webhost over git. However, git is much better for storing files :)
3. I was honestly pretty suprised how easy the 000webhost was to upload files / put the site online. Back when CPANEL was outdated it took FOREVER to get a working site - I think nowadays anyone can figure out how to host a simple webpage / site with no prior tech knowledge.
